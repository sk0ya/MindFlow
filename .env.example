# Ollama Configuration
# Base URL for Ollama API service
# Default: http://localhost:11434
# For deployed apps, you may want to use a publicly accessible Ollama instance
VITE_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Note: When deploying to production (e.g., GitHub Pages), 
# the default localhost URL will not work due to CORS policy.
# Consider using:
# - A remote Ollama instance with CORS enabled
# - A proxy server to handle CORS
# - Or disable AI features for production builds
